				Render liquid slopes a second time over tiles, fixing the infamous
				bug where standing on sloped tiles under liquids doesn't tint entities correctly.
				This also renders the tile a second time, meaning the tile will be effected by the liquid shaders.
				I think it makes for a neat effect, but doing so comes with nuanced issues:
				- Hit progress will not show on tiles directly next to liquids.
				- There are slight issues with lighting on slopes in some cases.

				Does nothing if Nitrate is enabled due to an incompatibility.
