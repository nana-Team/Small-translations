Implements simpler, compatible performance tweaks: it's *not quite* Nitrate. Also includes configurable bug fixes.

Made by me, Tomat, 50% of Nitrate.

Should work fine with Nitrate.

Below is a brief summary of performance patches made by this mod and their impact on their respective targets.

BetterGetColorSlice: Makes GetColor4Slice and GetColor9Slice ~8x faster from limited testing. Small general performance boost during tile rendering.

FasterAssetLoading: Currently just rewrites certain cases of image loading to reduce generated garbage which results in an admirable speed-up. Won't be too noticeable typically since the work is threaded.

FasterBfsPlotTile: Makes PlotTileArea ~25x faster. Massive performance boost to Fairy Glowsticks and Dirt Bombs; allows 1000 Fairy Glowsticks to consume <4% of frame time (vs 89% in vanilla).

FasterRenderBlack: Makes DrawBlack ~3x faster for me, depends on your logical processor count. Offloads work to multiple cores.

IgnoreAssemblyJit: Disables JITing of mod assemblies on load to speed up load times. Unfortunately may increase initial micro-stutter in-game, may become configurable eventually.

Configurable bug fixes:

"Better Liquid Slopes": (disabled by default) See the in-game config option for more information.
