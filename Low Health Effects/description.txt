This mod adds visual and audio effects while on low health and after taking damage.

The following effects can occur:
 - Colored and distorted screen border
 - A pulsating effect to go along with a heartbeat that gets faster at lower health
 - Audio muffling
 - Ringing after taking a particularly heavy hit

These effects are all individually controllable. Though the default values were finely balanced, the mod's parameters were designed to be experimented with. Find the settings that work best for you!

By default, low health effects are only active during boss fights and the muffling will affect the boss music as well. These can both be changed.
The thresholds for what is considered "low health" or a "heavy hit" are customizable too.

The mod is multiplayer compatible.

Compatible with UltraSonic's custom music.
